## Overview
This app is one I created as part of a project I assigned to my middle school mathmeatics students. For their end-of-the-semester project they were to design a game which requires math in order to win the game. I chose to do the project too and, this case, create a quiz application which randomly generates mathematics questions, checks answers, and adds/deducts points based on gameplay.

### Requirements:

- At least 3 levels
- At least 2 mathematics questions per level 
- Players must answer the mathematics questions correctly before moving to the next level
